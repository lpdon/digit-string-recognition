# Digit String Recognition

## Data

First download the CAR-A and CAR-B dataset from http://www.orand.cl/en/icfhr2014-hdsr/#datasets.  
Or use your own dataset and adapt its structure to match that of the CAR datasets.

## Train

The training can be started by running the `train.py` script. For example

```bash
python train.py --data '/path/to/ORAND-CAR-2014/CAR-A/' --epochs 20
```

Check `python train.py -h` for all possible options.
